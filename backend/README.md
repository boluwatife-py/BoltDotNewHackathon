## Medical Knowledge Base

The AI assistant has comprehensive knowledge about:

### Supplements Covered
- **Vitamin D3** - Bone health, immune support, calcium absorption
- **Omega-3** - Heart health, brain function, anti-inflammatory
- **Magnesium** - Muscle function, sleep quality, bone health
- **Vitamin C** - Immune support, antioxidant protection
- **Probiotics** - Digestive health, immune support
- **Melatonin** - Sleep regulation, circadian rhythm

### Medical Expertise Areas
- Drug interactions and contraindications
- Age-specific health considerations (40+, 50+)
- Supplement timing optimization
- Side effect monitoring
- Safety guidelines and warnings
- Medication adherence strategies

## Safety Features

### Built-in Safety Measures
- ‚úÖ Always recommends healthcare provider consultation
- ‚úÖ Never provides medical diagnoses
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based information only
- ‚úÖ Age-appropriate guidance
- ‚úÖ Drug interaction warnings
- ‚úÖ Clear safety disclaimers

### Fallback System
- Intelligent offline responses when Gemini API is unavailable
- Context-aware fallbacks using supplement data
- Medical safety maintained even in offline mode
- Graceful error handling with helpful alternatives

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-flask

# Run tests
pytest
```

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code
black app.py

# Check code style
flake8 app.py
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini AI API key | Required |
| `FLASK_ENV` | Flask environment | `development` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8000` |

## Deployment

### Using Gunicorn (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Gunicorn
pip install gunicorn

# Run with multiple workers
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
```

### Environment Setup for Production
```bash
# Set environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key"
export FLASK_ENV="production"
export PORT="8000"

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

## Security Considerations

- üîê **API Key Security** - Never commit API keys to version control
- üõ°Ô∏è **CORS Configuration** - Properly configured for frontend integration
- üìù **Input Validation** - All inputs are validated and sanitized
- üö´ **No Medical Diagnosis** - AI never provides medical diagnoses
- ‚öïÔ∏è **Healthcare Provider Emphasis** - Always recommends professional consultation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gemini API Key Not Working**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check API key permissions
   - Ensure billing is enabled on Google Cloud

2. **CORS Errors**
   - Verify Flask-CORS is installed
   - Check frontend URL configuration

3. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Logs and Monitoring
The application logs all interactions and errors. Check console output for debugging information.
